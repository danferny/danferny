- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel Fern
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in, well, most things tech related, especially retro computing and game development.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently mastering React & React Native but I'm very interested in C++ and Swift too!
- ðŸ“« You can contact me via email: daniel@danielfern.co.uk
  Visit my website: http://danielfern.co.uk (it's currently being redesigned so excuse any issues for now please :) )

I'm an avid user of Windows, Linux and MacOS - both ARM with an M1 and x86 with Intel. So for any software porting for MacOS let me know if I can help.
